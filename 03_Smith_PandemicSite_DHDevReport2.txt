Comparative analysis of tools & text and image.

In this essay, I will be discussing my initial impressions, and the advantages and disadvantages to using Blogger, WordPress, Flickr, and Omeka as tools for Digital Humanities projects. This essay concludes by stating that, in my opinion, Omeka and WordPress are probably the tools I would prefer to use depending on whether I want to display information like a museum or chronologically.

The four websites tested for this comparative analysis are Blogger, WordPress, Flickr, and Omeka. Blogger and WordPress have very similar functionality, but WordPress appears to be targeting a professional audience compared to Blogger’s simpler design. They both are designed to present information in a blog-style written daily by entry. Blogger and WordPress are great at showcasing daily entries in a website. Blogger showcases a Microsoft Word style form when writing information, while WordPress allows for more style. However, both Blogger and WordPress feel simplified in terms of providing good metadata and presentation to images and videos unlike with Flickr and Omeka. Flickr is a website designed to showcase images and videos in a gallery collection. It acts basically as a storage system. Flickr allows for excellent metadata tags on its photos and videos which showcases the recorded information of where they were taken, with what they were taken with, and other small pieces of data reflected on the picture or video’s page. However, Flickr feels primarily like a storage system for storytelling through images and does not allow a greater context to the images on an entire website unlike the others in this essay. Omeka serves as a professional style website that can provide users with collections and displays sections of the website based on different criteria the user puts in. It does not necessarily have to be by date but can be by topic or by however the user wishes to tell information through storytelling. Omeka would probably be the best website for illustrating metadata on a variety of types of media that includes not only images and video, but also maps, soundclips, music, people, GIFs, and any other digital information. Using collections, Omeka can serve as a digital museum for showcasing information on a topic. Although it is versatile, Omeka can be confusing for people unfamiliar with it because setting up the site to work can be a bit of a pain when it does not register correctly. Even while working through collections and providing information to individual pieces, such as images, Omeka can feel overwhelming in the amount of information that people are able to provide.

In terms of which ones I prefer to use, it would depend on the situation. I am already very familiar with how Omeka and WordPress work from previous classes taken. Omeka would be the best for websites in which I would like to discuss a few topics in depth and display images related to that topic. It would be great for a museum system. WordPress would be great for displaying observations that occur daily, somewhat like a diary system. While Blogger and Flickr are not bad per se, they would be less fit for a large project than Omeka and WordPress. As I am currently using WordPress for this Digital Humanities publication, this website is working fine enough for organizing these blog posts based on the order in which I had done them. Flickr is hosting the images for the Digital Humanities Dev Report 3 which is perfectly suitable for the purpose of this assignment. Considering Blogger is a more simplified version of WordPress, I probably would not use it for any of the projects and rather would use it for personal note taking.
